Complete linkage, Single linkage, and Girvan-Newman clustering algorithm implemented from scratch.

For each of the part, I have created separate source file namely 'ClusteringPart1', 'ClusteringPart2' and 'ClusteringPart3'.
I have wrote all the source file in python programming language.

Each of my source code reading from 'Excel'file for further purpose. 

I have import below packages in my source code:
    numpy, pandas, networkx, matplotlib.pyplot

One must install all these packages before running all my source code.
